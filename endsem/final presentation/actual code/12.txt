Hi,
Let me tell you a little about myself. Before I came to the silly zoo and met my cartoonist friend Pauline Comanor, I lived in the rain forest. My mother carried me around on her back and we swung from the tall trees. I think it's the most wonderful place in the world, and so would you. They cut so much of my rain forest down, I had to leave, but I can still tell you about my rain-forest friends and some of the things I've seen there.

So come along and we'll travel to places you've never been before and meet some of the residents of my first home, the tropical rain forest of Brazil.

Your very best friend, Chunky Monkey
